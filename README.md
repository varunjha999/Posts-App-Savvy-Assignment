1. search
2.  pagination
3.  responsive
4.  Api integration
5.  context-api
6.  Axios
7.  list of post



As a part of the selection process, below is the coding challenge that you will need to complete within the next 4 days and
submit.
You are given a simple React application that displays a list of posts retrieved from an API. Your task is to implement the
API integration and testing logic for this application, as well as add some additional functionality.

Requirements
* The application should retrieve the list of posts from the following API endpoint:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
* The retrieved data should be stored in the application state and rendered as a list of posts.
* The application should allow the user to filter the list of posts by title or body text using a search input.
* The application should handle errors that may occur during the API request and display an error message to the user.
* The application should include unit tests to ensure that the API integration, filtering, and error handling logic works
correctly.

Technical Details
* You can use any React library or framework of your choice (e.g. Redux, Context API, etc.) to manage state.
* You can use any testing library or framework of your choice (e.g. Jest, React Testing Library, etc.) to implement unit tests.
* You can use any HTTP library of your choice (e.g. Axios, Fetch, etc.) to make API requests.

Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Correctness: Does the application retrieve the list of posts correctly from the API, filter posts based on the search
query, and handle errors properly?
2. Code quality: Is the code well-structured and easy to understand? Does it follow best practices for React
development?
3. Testing: Are there unit tests that cover the API integration, filtering, and error handling logic? Do the tests pass
and provide adequate coverage?
4. Time and task management: Did you complete the challenge within a reasonable amount of time? Did you
prioritize the requirements and manage your time effectively?

Bonus Points
You can earn bonus points for implementing the following additional features:
1. Pagination: Allow the user to view the list of posts in pages, with a configurable number of posts per page.
2. Sorting: Allow the user to sort the list of posts by date or title.
3. Responsive design: Make the application responsive and mobile-friendly.

Submission
You can submit your solution as a GitHub repository containing the code and any necessary instructions to run the
application and tests. Make sure the project is runnable.








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
